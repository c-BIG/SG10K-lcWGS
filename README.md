# lcWGS PRS imputation joint GRIDS-NPM x Nalagenetics project
Code repository for the collaboration between GRIDS-NPM (GIS) and Nalagenetics to develop a the genotyping
component of Nalagenetics SG10K_Health-imputation-enhanced individual's low coverage Whole Genome Sequencing (lcWGS) polygenic risk score (PRS) based risk prediction of complex disorders.

We, thus, aim to deveop a secured, privacy-preserving WGS analysis infratrucuture to perform imputation with SG10K_Health, a SG-local multi-ethnic reference panel, in order to improve the accuracy of the derived genotype calls
This, in turn, will empower the compuation of individual's privacy-preserved genetic risk predictions that are more relevant for the local population
